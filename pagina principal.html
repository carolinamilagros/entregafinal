                    <p class="parro1"> <span> s </span>ince they were founded in 1892, the Liverpool Football Club name
                        was synonymous with fame and glory. Internationally, Liverpool is the most successful British
                        club of all time with plenty of European trophies on their record. They are one of the most
                        popular football teams in the world, with over 200 supporter clubs in at least 50 different
                        countries. And yet, their magnificent history will forever be plagued by two of the worst
                        stadium disasters of all time: Heysel and Hillsborough. </p>

        <h2 class="bill"> The Bill Shankly era </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="perri">
            <p class="perro">Though an immensely popular club even then, Liverpool FC were not particularly consistent in
                the post-WWII
                period. After claiming their fourth League title in 1947, the club entered a period of mediocrity which
                culminated with their relegation to Second Division in 1954. Things took a turn for the better after Bill
                Shankly was hired as manager, however; Shankly's first order of business was to release the entire first
                team
                squad. He then turned the club's storage room into the famous "Boot Room", a place that would serve as the
                coaches' secret meeting place for the next three decades. </p>
    
            <p class="perro"> Shankly's unorthodox methods bore fruit soon enough. After making their way back to the First
                Division in
                1962, Liverpool won the League two years later. During the reminder of Shankly's tenure as manager, they
                claimed an additional two League titles (1966, 1973), two FA Cups (1965, 1974), as well as their first
                European trophy ‚Äì the 1973 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Shankly resigned from his job due to a need for a break,
                leaving the club in the hands of his assistant, Bob Paisley. </p>
            <h2 class="be"> Adding more trophies to the collection </h2>
    
            <p>The change of personnel did not do much to stop Liverpool's dominance. Under Paisley, Liverpool were a
                remarkably consistent team; during his nine years in charge, the club won an incredible six League titles
                and three League Cups. Their reign spread over Europe as well, with Liverpool winning one UEFA Cup and three
                European Cups in the period between 1976 and 1981. After Paisley's retirement in 1983, his assistant Joe
                Fagan continued the successful tradition by leading the team to a Treble in his first season in charge. </p>
